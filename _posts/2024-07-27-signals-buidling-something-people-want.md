title: "Signals That You Are Building Something People Want"
---
When building a new product, it often feels like you're walking through a dense fog. You may be confident that what you're creating is important and needed, but user metrics and feedback can frequently lead to frustration, fear, and a lack of confidence.

On my journey to creating a product with strong product-market fit (where over 2/3 of users would be very disappointed if it didn’t exist), I discovered some key indicators that provided confidence I was working on something meaningful:

#### 1. Heavy Customer Support Load
An influx of customer support inquiries is a positive sign. Users reaching out about issues and a high engagement rate with customer support indicate that they care deeply about your product. We often found ourselves inundated with support requests, which was a clear marker of user investment.

#### 2. Genuine Curiosity
Hearing a lot of “wait, what?” when you describe your product is encouraging. This genuine curiosity from others is a great sign that your product is intriguing and worth attention.

#### 3. Early Partnerships with Reputable Organizations
Securing partnerships with large, reputable organizations early on is a significant confidence booster. We were able to integrate with major, well-respected apps because these organizations saw the value in our unique offering, even when the product was relatively immature.

#### 4. The “Too Good to Be True” Reaction
When users tell you that your product seems too good to be true, it can be a hurdle to overcome, but it’s also a sign that you're on to something. If many people think your product’s promise is almost unbelievable, it means you have a compelling value proposition.

#### 5. Strong Power Users
Having a few power users who are highly engaged and profitable, even if most users are not fully activated, is another positive indicator. These power users can provide valuable insights and validation.

#### 6. Regular Requests for Feature Improvements and Bug Fixes
Frequent user requests for improvements and bug reports indicate strong engagement and a desire for your product to succeed. While it can be overwhelming to consider how to address all these requests, or even to figure out how to implement some of them, such interactions demonstrate that users are genuinely invested in your product’s future. Their feedback is invaluable and reflects their commitment to seeing the product evolve and improve.

### A Caveat: Modern User Expectations

The old startup mantra of “if people are using a broken product, then you are on to something” is not as applicable today as it was 10-20 years ago. The overwhelming majority of users are now less willing to tolerate UI/UX issues or serious bugs. This shift makes it more challenging to gauge whether you are on the right path without developing a high-quality product from the outset.
