ðŸ‘‹ I'm the Founder & CEO at <a href='https://www.talkhiring.com/' target='_blank'>Talk Hiring</a>.  We're building a realistic mock interviewing tool with instant feedback that's fully automated. 
I was formerly a Senior Software Engineer at x.ai, an AI meeting scheduling tool, and graduated from Duke with degrees in ECE & CS.<br>
I enjoy watching the dumbest comedies, pushing the limits of what you can air fry, and biking uphill more than downhill. 
If you want to contact me, my email is harris DOT osserman AT gmail DOT com<br>
I don't, by any means, think that I know what I'm doing when building companies, but I think that I have a lot of experience to share!
