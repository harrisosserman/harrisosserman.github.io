ðŸ‘‹ I'm the Founder & CEO at <a href='https://www.talkhiring.com/' target='_blank'>Talk Hiring</a>.  We launched multiple career services platforms which did > $1MM ARR, providing nearly 75,000 users each year with access to career guidance and resources.
I was formerly a Senior Software Engineer at [x.ai](https://x.ai/), an AI meeting scheduling tool, and graduated from Duke with degrees in ECE & CS.<br>
I enjoy watching the [dumbest comedies](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109686/), pushing the limits of what you can air fry, and biking uphill more than downhill. 
If you want to contact me, my email is harris DOT osserman AT gmail DOT com<br>
I don't, by any means, think that I know what I'm doing when building companies, but I think that I have a lot of experience to share!
